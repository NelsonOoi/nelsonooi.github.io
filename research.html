                        I'm currently a research assistant to Prof. Karan Mehta in the Photonics and Quantum Electronics
                        Group at Cornell.
                        My research centers on investigating high-coherence control methods for trapped-ion
                        quantum information processing devices.

                        There are experimental and computational aspects to my work.
                        <br> <br>
                        My experimental work currently involves setting up a fiber noise
                        cancelation system for the 729nm
                        laser system used for ion qubit addressing. Drawing upon on the
                        method outlined in Ma et. al. (1994), I led the layout and implementation of the beam path, and
                        created the bill of materials for the overall system.
                        Working with PhD candidate Hamim Mahmud Rivy, I gained a strong background in using experimental
                        optics equipment, laser beam alignment techniques, and foundational photonics principles.
                        <br> <br>
                        My computational research involves simulating systems for
                        high-coherence ion qubit manipulation. During the summer of 2023, I developed a novel algorithm
                        to
                        optimize permanent magnet shapes for
                        high-uniformity magnetic field generation. These high-uniformity
                        magnetic fields would be integral
                        for ensuring stable Zeeman level splitting in ions at different regions of the ion trap, thus
                        mitigating ion qubit dephasing. Implemented in Python, my algorithm was able to optimize magnet
                        geometries to result in a
                        1000x improvement in field uniformity over existing designs, suggesting that there
                        could
                        be significant benefits in using these optimized geometries to improve ion qubit coherence.
                        <br> <br>
                        I am also working on numerically simulating surface electrode trap potentials for ion
                        confinement. I
                        first characterized the ion trap electrodes in Python, determining
                        the
                        spatial electric
                        potential distribution due to a unit voltage applied to each electrode. This is based on a
                        method
                        based on Allcock et. al. (2011). Following that, I generated different basis voltage sets for
                        different trapping potential configurations, i.e. axial, tilt, y-compensation. I am currently
                        working to optimize the trap depth of the total trapping potential seen by the ion.
