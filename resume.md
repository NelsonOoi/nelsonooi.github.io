Research
Trapped-ion Researcher, Photonics & Quantum Electronics Group (Prof. Karan Mehta), Cornell University. January 2023 - present
Devised novel permanent magnet optimization algorithm for generating high-homogeneity magnetic fields to improve trapped-ion qubit coherence. Improved B-field inhomogeneity ~1000x, from 100ppm to 0.004ppm in Python simulations.
Implementing fiber-noise cancelation for 729nm laser using heterodyning for error signal generation. Gained extensive experience using optics elements (polarizers, AOMs), and diagnostic tools (beam profilers, oscilloscopes) to implement beam path.
Currently investigating ion confinement by optimizing trap electrode potentials using Python-based electrostatics simulations.
I am one of only four students invited to present their research to the distinguished Cornell Engineering College Council in 2023.


Hardware Engineering Projects
Digital Logic VLSI Integrated Circuit Module Design in Cadence Virtuoso. January 2023 - June 2023
Created hierarchical schematics and layouts for digital logic IC modules in 90nm PDK, gained significant experience with DRC and LVS workflow. Modules implemented from transistor-level: 8-bit ripple/PTL adders with minimized area-delay product, registers.
Devised 24 test suites: created custom auto-tester module in VerilogA, and wrote MATLAB script to automate waveform verification.
I was invited by Professor Edwin Kan to make a tutorial for a VLSI course at Cornell University.


Photonics Waveguide Design & Simulation in KLayout and MATLAB. March - May 2023
Designed a 4-to-4 multi-mode interferometer in KLayout, achieved even power splitting (15-30% per output port) in simulation.
Implemented beam-propagation method in MATLAB to simulate the MMI's performance under single-mode single-port excitation.


300W Wave Energy Power Relay PCB in KiCAD & Embedded System Control, SEA Lab, Cornell University. February - May 2023
Designed a 2-layer, 300W-rated power supply PCB for a wave energy-powered electricity generator for Cornell’s SEA Lab.
Created module footprints; designed schematic and completed PCB place and route in KiCAD with design for testing.
Led PCB bring-up by soldering, conducting unit tests and integrating microcontroller; held design reviews with mechanical teams.
Engineered finite-state machine in C to manage power routing, enabling user control and safe power-down in unlikely emergencies.

Software Engineering Work
Founder & Full-stack Developer Lead, Swapp, campus marketplace app. January 2021 - June 2022 
Founded, led, and coached app dev team of 10 members to create Swapp, the 2022 Cornell Sustainability Project of the Year.
Swapp is a marketplace app for students to trade pre-loved items, designed to kickstart a circular economy on campus.
Built app from scratch: developed frontend in React Native and Expo, using React Hooks and best practices for stateful UI.
Built backend in Firebase: consisting of database, backfill scripts, and query indices, with full text search integration in Algolia. 
Scaled app user-base upwards of 150 new users in 4 months, gaining significant experience in project management and app dev.

Full-Stack Developer Intern, Snackpass, food ordering & restaurant platform backed by Y Combinator. June - August 2021
Engineered a new full-stack (front and backend) feature for the platform’s storefront purchase system using React Native (written in React Redux, TypeScript) and NodeJS within a 3-person project team; enabling Snackpass to onboard a crucial business partner.
Completed 20+ feature tickets, gaining significant experience in pair-programming, PR reviews, and CI/CD workflow in GitHub.
Developed new server-side methods for time-sensitive transactions and notifications, wrote test suites in Jest to verify correctness.
Leadership


Co-founder & Mentorship Lead, Quantum Computing Association, Cornell University. July 2023 - present
Launched Cornell University’s first quantum-centered student association with the aim of education, outreach, and career advising.
Currently organizing the curriculum and teaching the 'Fundamentals of Quantum Computing' course for new members.
