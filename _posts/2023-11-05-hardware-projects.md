## 300W Wave Energy Power Relay PCB in KiCAD & Embedded System Control, SEA Lab, Cornell University. February - May 2023
Designed a 2-layer, 300W-rated power supply PCB for a wave energy-powered electricity generator for Cornellâ€™s SEA Lab.
Created module footprints; designed schematic and completed PCB place and route in KiCAD with design for testing.
Led PCB bring-up by soldering, conducting unit tests and integrating microcontroller; held design reviews with mechanical teams.
Engineered finite-state machine in C to manage power routing, enabling user control and safe power-down in unlikely emergencies.
